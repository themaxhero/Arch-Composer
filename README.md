# Arch-Composer
## Introduction
My objective with this project is:
 - To have a pre-made archlinux install (inside a file) that I can rely on.
 - Waste minimal effort to start the install.
 - Make my computer be exactly how i want it to be since the very first reboot.
 - Remove the need of being all the time in front of the computer during the install proccess.

## Objectives
 - [ ] Manage the partitions during the install.
 - [ ] Set user's and root's password during the install (for security reasons)
 - [ ] Select all wanted packages before installing (and organize them with categories to make things clear).
 - [ ] Enable/Start all the services from the install.
 - [ ] Add repositories, trust repository keys in all the ways possible during the install.
 - [ ] Edit configuration files during installation, without the need to caring about them later.
 - [ ] Select bootloader and boot method and letting the script handle it for me.
